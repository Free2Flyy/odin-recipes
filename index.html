    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This deep-dish pizza recipe yields a thick, flavorful crust that's perfect for holding all your favorite toppings. The long rise time allows the dough to develop a complex flavor and a chewy texture.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ⅛ cups warm water (110 to 115 degrees F)</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup corn oil</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>Butter (as needed, for greasing)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine yeast mixture, flour, corn oil, and kosher salt in a large stand mixer fitted with the dough hook; knead until dough holds together but is still slightly sticky, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Form dough into a ball and transfer to a buttered bowl. Turn to coat dough with butter, then cover the bowl with a towel and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 6 hours.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes. Press dough into a 10-inch deep-dish pizza pan.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>To Make the Pizza</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add cheese, toppings, and tomatoes that you've flavored with garlic, basil, oregano, etc.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza in an oven preheated to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for about 30 minutes, depending on your oven. You can prebake the crust for 10-15 minutes before adding toppings if desired.</li>
    </ol>
